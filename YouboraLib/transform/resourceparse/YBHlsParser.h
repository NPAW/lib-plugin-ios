/**
 * Class that asynchronously parses an HLS resource in order to get to the transport stream URL.
 *
 * The point behind this class is that some customers do not host the HLS manifest in the same host
 * or even CDN where the actual content chunks are located.
 *
 * Since the CDN detection is performed with the resource url, it is essential that this resource
 * url is pointing to the CDN that is actually hosting the chunks.
 *
 * HLS manifests can be multi-level so this class uses a recursive approach to get to the final
 * chunk file.
