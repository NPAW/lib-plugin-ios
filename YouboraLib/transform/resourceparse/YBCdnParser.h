/**
 * Class that asynchronously tries to get information about the CDN where a given resource is
 * hosted.
 * The info we care about is the CDN code itself, the node host and node type.
 *
 * The CDN is queried with http HEAD requests. This only will work if the customer has properly
 * configured their CDN.
 *
 * When HEAD requests are performed against the resources, the CDN returns a set of headers that
 * containing info about the cdn header and / or cdn type.
 *
 * Each CDN is different; some require special headers to be set when the HEAD request is performed
 * and others don't. Also, the info can come back in any fashion of ways, sometimes both type and host
 * come in the same response header while sometimes they're in different headers. The format of these
 * response headers is also different from CDN to CDN, so a different regex is used for each CDN.
 *
 * Lastly, as the values indicating the CDN type are also different, we need a specific mapping for
 * each one.
 *
 * This is the process to add a new CDN to the parser.
 * <ol>
 *      <li>CDN code. The class that holds all the needed info is YBCdnConfig. It should be
 *      constructed passing the CDN code that represents this CDN. This is a YOUBORA code and can
 *      be found <a href="http://mapi.youbora.com:8081/cdns">here</a>.</li>
 *      <li>Response headers. The CDN will answer the HEAD request with headers that contain the
 *      info we're looking for. We should add as many YBParsableResponseHeader as needed.
 *      The constructor needs three things:
 *      <ul>
 *          <li>Element. Specify if this header will contain the Host, Type, or both. Note that HostAndType 
 *          is not the same as TypeAndHost.
 *          The order is the same as how will they will appear in the header response value. This can
 *          also have the "Name" value, indicating that this field value is actually the CDN name</li>
 *          <li>Header response name. Header from where the info will be got from.</li>
 *          <li>Regex. Regular expression to extract host and/or type. If only one of them is expected
 *          define one capturing group, and two otherwise.</li>
 *      </ul>
 *      </li>
 *      <li>Request headers. Add headers to YBCdnConfig's requestHeaders if this CDN
 *      requires special headers to be set in order to respond with the info we want.</li>
 *      <li>Type parser. Once the CDN Type value is found (using one of the previously set
 *      YBParsableResponseHeader) this parser will be called passing it the found value
 *      as a String. This parser should return Hit or Miss depending on the Type string parameter.
 *      If it doesn't match with what would you expect,
 *      return Unknown instead.</li>
 * </ol>
